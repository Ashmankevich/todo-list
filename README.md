### The benefits of using a ToDo-List

1. Improves your memory: A to do list acts as an external memory aid. It’s only possible to hold a few pieces of information at one time. Keep a to do list and you’ll be able to keep track of everything, rather than just a few of the tasks you need to do. 

2. Increases productivity: Your list will help you stay focused on the tasks that are the most important.

3. Helps with motivation: To do lists are a great motivational tool because you can use them to clarify your goals.
