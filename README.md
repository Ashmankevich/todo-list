# Task-manager 
**This is a web-application to help manage various tasks.**
To organize the workspace for your tasks, we created a multi-function board with cards, which are distributed to different columns depending on the implementation phase: backlog, in progress, review or done.
Here in this app users have accesss to a wide range of different features:
